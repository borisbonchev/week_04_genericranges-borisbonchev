/**
 * The range's reason of existence is testing, measuring, finding or avoiding
 * overlaps.
 *
 * <p>
 * The range should comply to the invariant that the start is less or equal it's
 * end. Depending on the type, this can mean start is (left of, before, lower)
 * than end, or equal to end.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This range definition is of the <i>half open</i> type. The start is included
 * in the range, the end is not. The mathematical notation for half open ranges
 * of this kind is [start,end), indeed with two different brackets. The square
 * bracket is the closed end, the parenthesis is at the open end.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The demarcation and distance units can be of different types, like a dates as
 * demarcation and days between them.</p>
